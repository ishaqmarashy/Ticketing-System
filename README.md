Bug reporting system
Design and created a system where users can add tickets to the database to report errors they encounter. 
The users can view, edit and create new tickets(limited CRUD operation accessibility).
Admins have a much higher level of access as they can edit, view and delete both tickets and users through administrative views. 
Be sure to see the db folder for the seeded admin acc.
