# Bug reporting system
Designed and created a system for reporting software bugs with user and admin functionalities.
The purposed of this was to gain familiarity with C# and ASP.NET Core 3.1

## Features:
1- Report, view, edit, and create tickets for software errors.

2- Access control for efficient admin management of tickets and users.

3- Developed using MVC principles for structured architecture.

4- The users can view, edit and create new tickets(limited CRUD operation accessibility).

5- Admins have a much higher level of access as they can edit, view and delete both tickets and users through administrative views.
